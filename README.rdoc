Don't forget to run rake db:seed before using the application.
It sets up an admin user and a bunch of products to start with.
Other than that the application setup is pretty simple. Just make sure youâ€™re using
Ruby-2.2.3 and run bundle install in the application directory. Run rake db:create,
rake db:migrate, rake db:seed and then rails server.
